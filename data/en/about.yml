  title : "What is an Integration Environment?"
  content : "Our approach is to integrate and enrich established services and workflows. 
  
  We do not want to break or re-invent processes but try to provide additional value by connecting otherwise separate services. To achieve this, we leverage contextual information provided by local identidy management services, publicly available organizational information and stadardized interfaces for access management. 
  
  Ultimately we strive to enable researchers to not only fullfill the requirements of good scientific practice but to enable natively digital research processes."

We aim to solve the common trade-off between specificity and generalization of metadata by allowing to use multiple application profiles for each project. So you can select the best schema to describe your data on a fine grained level while keeping everything in accordance with established standards. "
