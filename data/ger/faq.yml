      - question : "What data can I store in Coscine?"
        answer : "Coscine can integrate different data sources (resource types). Depending on the resource type, e.g. Gitlab, the rules of use of Gitlab still apply for data there. The research data storage (RDS) plays a special role; it is only provided by Coscine and allows exclusively to be used for research data."

      - question : "I can't find my projects anymore!"
        answer : "Coscine allows you to log in with two methods. It is possible that you have logged in with RWTH SSO previously and are now logged in via ORCID (or the other way around).
         You can easily link both accounts in your user profile to have access to all your projects regardless of the log-in method."

      - question : "I can not creates RDS resources anymore!"
        answer : "Each project has a storage quota for RDS resources. If you have used that quota you can not create more resources of that type until you apply for more storage. For the pilot phase this application means contacting us. "
